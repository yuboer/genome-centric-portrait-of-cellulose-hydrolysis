####---------------section1. data preparation
#---for the entire procedure we will be needing the following:
#---1) copy all the .out.dm.ps files in the folder named as [dbCAN_results] generated from the dbCAN annotation platform to the "01_data" folder, in my case the root directory #-where this "01_data" folder locates is "Desktop/for_docker_image"
#---2) R script in the "02_code" folder as provided
#---3) Dockerfile as provided
#---4) an empty local folder named as "03_output" to store the output files from the workflow
#----put the Dockerfile and the 3 folders in one same root directory, in my case, this root directory is "Desktop/for_docker_image"

####----------------section 2. build and run the image
#---modify name of the local root directory if necessary, in my case, the #local root directory is "Desktop/for_docker_image/"
#---in my case, with "pwd" command on mac, the local root directory is shown as: /Users/yuboer/Desktop/for_docker_image

##----------step2.1. building image
#---note: use the terminal to navigate to the folder (in my case, it is #"Desktop/for_docker_image/" as indicated by the pwd command listed #above) where the Dockerfile is located and build the image with: 
docker build -t cellulosic_genome_annotation .

##---------step2.2. running image
#---note: 1) using the -v argument tells Docker which local folder to map to #the created folders inside the container
#---2) with the command line below, the container will get aceess to data #in the local folder "Desktop/for_docker_image/01_data", and the output from the workflow "03_output" will be saved locally at "Desktop/for_docker_image/03_output"
docker run -it --rm -v ~/"Desktop/for_docker_image"/01_data:/01_data -v ~/"Desktop/for_docker_image"/03_output:/03_output cellulosic_genome_annotation


#### feel free to download this "for_docker_image" folder as a whole and try with the data provided in the subdirectory of "01_data"
